                         **TRUE-FALSE****—Conceptual**


                          1. The income statement is useful in assessing the risk or uncertainty of achieving future cash flows.



                           2. A strength of the income statement as compared to the balance sheet is that items which cannot be measured reliably can be reported in the income statement.



                            3. Earnings management generally makes income statement information more useful for predicting future earnings and cash flows.



                             4. The transaction approach of income measurement focuses on the income-related activities that have occurred during the period.



                              5. Companies frequently report income tax expense as the last item before net income on a single-step income statement.



                               6. Revenues and gains increase both net income and owners’ equity.



                                7. The phrase “income from continuing operations” is used only when gains or losses on discontinued operations occur.



                                 8. The primary advantage of the multiple-step format lies in the simplicity of presentation and the absence of any implication that one type of revenue or expense item has priority over another.



                                  9. Gross profit and income from operations are reported on a multiple-step but not on a single-step income statement.



                                   10. The accounting profession has adopted a current operating performance approach to income reporting.



                                    11. Companies report the results of operations of a component of a business that will be disposed of separately from continuing operations.



                                     12. A company should report a restructuring charge as an extraordinary item because these write-offs are not part of a company’s ordinary and typical activities.



                                      13. Discontinued operations, extraordinary items, and unusual gains and losses are all reported net of tax in the income statement.



                                       14. Intraperiod tax allocation relates the income tax expense of a fiscal period to the specific items that give rise to the amount of the tax provision.



                                        15. A company that reports a discontinued operation or an extraordinary item must report per share amounts for these items.



                                         16. Dividends declared on common and preferred stock are subtracted from net income in the computation of earnings per share.
